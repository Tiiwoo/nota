# Nota: A Document Language for the Browser

<!-- [![.github/workflows/ci.yaml](https://github.com/nota-lang/nota/actions/workflows/ci.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/nota-lang/nota/actions/workflows/ci.yaml) -->

Nota is a language for writing documents, like academic papers and blog posts. The goal of Nota is to **bring documents into the 21st century**.

**Note (2023-10-19): Nota is undergoing a significant rewrite, so this repo will be stale for at least few months. Check back in around Spring 2024!**

If you're curious what I've been up to, check out my POPL 2024 paper ["A Core Calculus for Documents"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04368).
